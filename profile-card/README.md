## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Even though it was quite a straightforward design to accomplish, it definitely helped me understand the different ways to position and image on top of other elements.

After trying absolute positions, I came to the conclusion that setting a negative margin-top on the image was the approach that required less lines of code, which is something I like to think of for every design.

One thing that I haven't quite understood yet is that the background images have different color shades depending on the browser, even though I used an HSL color. For example, on Google Chrome it has a very teal accent, whereas in Firefox is leaning towards a light-blue, definitely something to learn more about.
