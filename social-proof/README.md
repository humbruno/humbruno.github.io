## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project I got to put into practice some Flexbox modifier like `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` as wel as alternative ways to position multiple background images on the body of the page.

I definitely need more practice with Flexbox, especially at the breakpoints where the content should transition between mobile-tablet and tablet-desktop
