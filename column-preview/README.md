## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Great project to put into practice media queries and differentiating the direction of the content according to these (flexbox' row and column).

My biggest takeaway (and proudest achievement) on this one was being able to write reusable classes that allowed me to style each card on a global scale and just add individual colors to each one.
