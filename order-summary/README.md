## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a great way to implement semantic HTML elements and more importantly, get into the habit of planning the markup and content structure before writing any CSS styling, having a well-structured HTML really make styling a lot easier.

It was also my first experience with media-queries, I found it hard finding what are the common max-width breakpoints so the content can scale with the viewport.

My biggest struggle was with the background, as when scaling the the viewport up & down, the background image start shifting upwards.
